# Backup

[Backup] (http://hel.io/wordpress/backup/) is a Wordpress plugin that makes backups of your Wordpress site locally or to
Google Drive.


## Description

Version 2.1 is out and it's full of improvements and new features!

If you use this plugin and find it useful please consider [donating](http://hel.io/donate/ "Make a donation for your
favorite WordPress plugin."). I have invested (and continue to do so) a lot of time and effort into making this a useful
and polished product even though at the moment I have no source of income. Even a small contribution helps a lot.

Backup is a plugin that provides backup capabilities for Wordpress. Backups are `zip` archives created locally and
uploaded to a folder of your choosing on Google Drive.

You are in total control of what files and directories get backed up.

- Upload the plugin to the `/wp-contents/plugins/` folder.
- Activate the plugin from the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
- Configure the plugin by following the instructions on the `Backup` settings page.

If you need support configuring the plugin click on the `help` button on the top right of the settings page.
