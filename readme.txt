Make backups of your WordPress site to Google Drive.

Version 2.1 is out and addresses some serious security issues, so everyone is advised to upgrade.

If you use this plugin and find it useful please consider [donating](http://hel.io/donate/ "Make a donation for your favorite WordPress plugin."). I have invested (and continue to do so) a lot of time and effort into making this a useful and polished product even though at the moment I have no source of income. Even a small contribution helps a lot.

Backup is a plugin that provides backup capabilities for WordPress. Backups are `zip` archives of created locally and uploaded to a folder of your choosing on Google Drive.

You are in total control of what gets backed up.

* Fine grained control over what gets backed up.
* Store backups locally and/or on Google Drive.
* Interrupted uploads to Google Drive automatically resume.
* Get email notifications when something goes wrong.
* The settings page interface uses standard WordPress elements to fit right in.
* Extensive contextual help included.
* Advanced options are provided to control the inner workings of the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do you plan to support backing up to other services? =

I am thinking of adding more services and will probably do so depending on user demand.

= Does the plugin work with versions of WordPress below 3.4? =

Apart from not being able to purge backups from Google Drive, Backup should work well with WordPress versions 3.0 and up. I do recommend upgrading to WordPress 3.4 though.
