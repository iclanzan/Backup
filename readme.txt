Make backups of your Wordpress site to Google Drive.

== Description ==

Version 2.1 is out and it's full of improvements and new features!

If you use this plugin and find it useful please consider [donating](http://hel.io/donate/ "Make a donation for your favorite WordPress plugin."). I have invested (and continue to do so) a lot of time and effort into making this a useful and polished product even though at the moment I have no source of income. Even a small contribution helps a lot.

Backup is a plugin that provides backup capabilities for Wordpress. Backups are `zip` archives created locally and uploaded to a folder of your choosing on Google Drive.

You are in total control of what files and directories get backed up. 

== Installation ==

The plugin requires WordPress 3.4 and is installed like any other plugin.

1. Upload the plugin to the `/wp-contents/plugins/` folder.
2. Activate the plugin from the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Configure the plugin by following the instructions on the `Backup` settings page.

If you need support configuring the plugin click on the `help` button on the top right of the settings page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do you plan to support backing up to other services? =

I am thinking of adding more services and will probably do so depending on user demand.

= Does the plugin work with versions of WordPress below 3.4? =

Apart from not being able to purge backups from Google Drive, Backup should work well with WordPress versions 3.0 and up. I do recommend upgrading to WordPress 3.4 though.
